# CSC645-01 Fall 2021 Computer Networks
Welcome to Computer Networks!. Please modify this README file with the following info: 

***IMPORTANT: You must add your student info below right after you create your class repository.
Failure to do that will result in your repository being deleted, and you will be dropped from
this class during the first week of instruction due to student's inactivity***

***IMPORTANT: Every time you finish a lab (or the course project) you must set the corresponding
assignment to 'completed' in the following table of assignments. Failure to do it will result in
your assignment not being graded. Take into consideration that this table of assignments is the
first thing I check before grading a lab or the course project.***
